<h4>The reason why I love Hockey</h4>
<p>There are many things I could say and explain as to why I truly love this game. Between all of the memories and friends I made from playing this sport, none compare to that of out of town tournaments. With all the excitement of being in a different city and the thrills of a tournament, I find that I play some of my best and most enjoyable games. Throughout my years growing up I played hockey year-round, so by the time I graduated high school it truly hit me that hockey would soon come to an end. This is what I thought going into college, however I recently discovered that my hockey was not coming to an end but instead a <i>new chapter</i>. The <i>new chapter</i> refers to college hockey and then adult hockey leagues for as long as I can still skate. <b>Adult hockey leagues</b> come with all different levels, so whether your just beginning or you were a stud in college there is a level for you!<a href="https://www.ccichockey.com/leagueinfo">Sign up today!</a></p>
